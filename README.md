# Lap-time-simulations-
Data created when doing lap time simulations for the VUB Racing vehicle of 2025. Openlap en Optimumlap are used.


For openlap: 
  - in the a__Cars file the 2025 VUBRacing car is set as the file 'car'. This has to be changed following the simulation you want to do
  - In the a__Tracks file acceleration, skidpad, 2012 endurance and 2012 autocross can be vieuwed. There where problems with the autocross track when the power was too high.
  - To use OPenlap see videos from Michael: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQiPsAzoaLqUtdVImOM4WjzoYrNUy7fve&si=8RVPn69e_F-R67Ug . And his projects github: https://github.com/mc12027

  - For optimumlap its best to see its manuel and play with it. 

The optimisation route that I took was too optimise a parameter in Optimumlap with for example the "batch" run option. Then use that value in the Openlap software. 

If you are a VUB Racing student you may contact me (Tom Paquet) for more information or my simulated data.
